4. Add Components
   "On the right-hand side, search for 'Arduino UNO' and drag it onto the workspace.
   Next, add an LED, a resistor (around 220 ohms), and wires to connect them."

6. Connect the Circuit
   "Wire the long leg (anode) of the LED to pin 13 of the Arduino, and the short leg (cathode) to one side of the resistor.
   Then connect the other side of the resistor to GND on the Arduino."
