# Microcontroller Learning Projects for Beginners
Welcome to this repository! This project is designed as a learning platform for high school students (and beginners) to explore microcontrollers such as the Arduino UNO and ESP32. The goal is to teach how to build and understand basic electronic projects using physical components and virtual simulations with Tinkercad.
 
üìÅ Repository Structure
This repository contains two main folders, each representing a hands-on mini project:

1. LED/
2. Automatic-Gate/

These folder contains:
Sample code to blink and control LEDs using microcontrollers.

* README.md that explains:
- The physical circuit setup (components, wiring).
- The virtual simulation steps using Tinkercad.

üß≠ How to Use This Repository
Start from any folder (e.g., LED) depending on which project you want to try first.
Read the included README.md in the project folder for detailed steps.

You can either:
Build the circuit physically using an Arduino/ESP32 board, or
Follow the Tinkercad guide to simulate it online.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Platforms Used
- Arduino UNO and ESP32
- Tinkercad Circuits (for simulation)
- Arduino IDE (for coding and uploading to boards)
- YouTube Tutorial Video:
